## Project Overview

**Station-2100** is a comprehensive aviation inventory and job card management system built with modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, Vite, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with Supabase
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Security**: Row-Level Security, AES-256 encryption, audit logging

## Current Progress (Intermediate â€“ September 2025)

### âœ… Completed Infrastructure

#### PowerShell Automation Scripts
- **`Station-2100.ps1`**: Comprehensive startup script with environment setup
- **`dev-health.ps1`**: Health monitoring and endpoint validation
- **`push-changes.ps1`**: Automated Git commit and push workflows

#### Development Environment
- **Sync Health Checks**: Real-time endpoint monitoring (`/__sync/ping`, `/__sync/status`)
- **Cursor Integration**: Seamless AI-assisted development workflow
- **GitHub Automation**: Automated commit and push processes
- **Environment Management**: Proper `.env.local` configuration with `ALLOW_SYNC=1`

#### Core Features
- **Customer Management**: Enhanced with State and Notes fields
- **Security Framework**: Comprehensive permission-based access controls
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation structure

### ðŸ”§ Current Status
- **Development Server**: âœ… Running at http://localhost:8080
- **Health Checks**: âœ… All sync endpoints operational
- **GitHub Integration**: âœ… Automated workflows active
- **Documentation**: âœ… Comprehensive and up-to-date

## Next Steps

## Development Workflow Restart Guide

### Quick Start
```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd "E:\Gtthande Dropbox\George Thande\Projects\Cusor\Station-2100"

# 2. Run automated setup script
.\Station-2100.ps1

# 3. Verify health checks
.\dev-health.ps1

# 4. Access application
# Open browser to http://localhost:8080
```

### Manual Setup (if needed)
```powershell
# Environment setup
echo "ALLOW_SYNC=1" | Out-File -FilePath .env.local -Encoding UTF8

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Verify sync endpoints
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/__sync/ping"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/__sync/status"
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Cursor Hangs**: Restart with summary context for continuity
- **Sync Issues**: Verify `.env.local` contains `ALLOW_SYNC=1`
- **Git Conflicts**: Use `pull-changes.ps1` for safe resolution
- **Environment Issues**: Run `Station-2100.ps1` for automated setup
