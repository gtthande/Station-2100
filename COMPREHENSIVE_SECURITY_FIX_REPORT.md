# Comprehensive Security Vulnerability Fixes - Implementation Report

## 🛡️ Security Fixes Implemented

### ✅ 1. AES-256 Encryption with Environment-Based Access Control

**Implementation:**
- Created `encrypt_sensitive_data()` and `decrypt_sensitive_data()` functions using AES-256 encryption
- Environment-specific encryption keys derived from database identifiers
- Separate encrypted storage tables for employee and customer data
- Automatic encryption triggers for sensitive data updates

**Security Enhancements:**
- **Employee Data**: Emails, phone numbers, addresses encrypted with admin/HR-only access
- **Customer Data**: Contact information encrypted with RBAC permissions
- **Key Management**: Environment-based key derivation with fallback protection
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to encrypted data tables

### ✅ 2. SECURITY DEFINER Functions Refactored

**Changes Made:**
- Converted `can_view_profile()` from SECURITY DEFINER to SECURITY INVOKER
- Updated `get_user_customer_permission_level()` to use SECURITY INVOKER
- Enhanced `log_profile_access()` with SECURITY INVOKER pattern
- Maintained necessary SECURITY DEFINER only where absolutely required

**Security Impact:**
- Reduced privilege escalation risks
- Improved function security posture
- Better adherence to principle of least privilege

### ✅ 3. Audit Trail Exposure Patched

**Implementation:**
- Created `security_audit_trail` table with limited data exposure
- Hash user agents instead of storing full strings
- Store only necessary audit data, not sensitive field values
- Enhanced `log_security_audit()` function with privacy protection

**Privacy Protections:**
- User agent hashing for privacy
- Summary-only change tracking (no sensitive data)
- IP address logging with proper access controls
- 7-year retention policy with automatic cleanup

### ✅ 4. HaveIBeenPwned API Integration

**Features:**
- Edge function `check-leaked-password` for real-time password validation
- K-anonymity implementation (only first 5 chars of SHA-1 hash sent)
- Severity-based warnings (low, medium, high, critical)
- Automatic security audit logging for compromised passwords

**Security Benefits:**
- Real-time breach detection during password changes
- Privacy-preserving password checking
- Comprehensive logging of security events
- User-friendly security warnings

### ✅ 5. Environment-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Implementation:**
- `environment_access_control` table for environment-specific permissions
- IP whitelisting capabilities
- Time-based access restrictions
- Role-based action permissions per environment

**Access Control Features:**
- Production/staging/development environment separation
- IP address restrictions for sensitive environments
- Business hours access controls
- Granular action permissions (read, write, admin)

## 🔧 Manual Configuration Required

### Supabase Dashboard Settings

You need to configure these settings in your Supabase Dashboard:

1. **OTP Expiry (2 minutes):**
   - Go to Authentication → Settings
   - Set OTP expiry to 120 seconds (2 minutes)
   - This addresses the "Auth OTP long expiry" warning

2. **Leaked Password Protection:**
   - Go to Authentication → Settings → Password Security
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
   - This addresses the "Leaked Password Protection Disabled" warning

## 📊 Security Status Summary

| SECURITY DEFINER Issues | ✅ FIXED | Converted to INVOKER where safe |
| Audit Trail Exposure | ✅ FIXED | Privacy-preserving audit logging |
| Password Security | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | HaveIBeenPwned integration |
| Environment Access Control | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | RBAC with IP/time restrictions |
| OTP Expiry | 🔄 MANUAL CONFIG | Set to 2 minutes in dashboard |
| Leaked Password Protection | 🔄 MANUAL CONFIG | Enable in dashboard |

   - Critical event alerts
   - Comprehensive audit trail view

### Database Functions

1. **Encryption Functions:**
   - `encrypt_sensitive_data()` - AES-256 encryption with environment keys
   - `decrypt_sensitive_data()` - Secure decryption with error handling
   - `get_encryption_key()` - Environment-based key derivation

2. **Audit Functions:**
   - `log_security_audit()` - Privacy-preserving audit logging
   - `auto_encrypt_employee_data()` - Automatic data encryption trigger

## 🔐 API Integration

### HaveIBeenPwned Edge Function

```typescript
// Usage example
const { checkPasswordWithWarning } = usePasswordSecurity();
const isSafe = await checkPasswordWithWarning(password);
```

**Features:**
- K-anonymity for privacy protection
- Severity-based user warnings
- Automatic security audit logging
- Graceful degradation if service unavailable

## 📈 Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring

1. **Security Events:**
   - Profile access attempts
   - Data encryption activities
   - Compromised password detections
   - Privilege escalation attempts

2. **Audit Queries:**
   ```sql
   -- Monitor compromised passwords
   SELECT * FROM security_audit_trail 
   WHERE event_type = 'password_security_check' 
   AND severity IN ('high', 'critical');
   
   -- Monitor unauthorized access attempts
   SELECT * FROM security_audit_trail 
   WHERE event_type = 'profile_access' 
   AND changes_summary->>'access_granted' = 'false';
   ```

## 🚨 Remaining Manual Tasks

### Critical Actions Required:

1. **Configure HAVEIBEENPWNED_API_KEY:**
   - Obtain API key from haveibeenpwned.com
   - Add to Supabase secrets (already set up in system)

2. **Supabase Dashboard Configuration:**
   - Set OTP expiry to 2 minutes
   - Enable leaked password protection

3. **Security Review:**
   - Test encrypted data access patterns
   - Verify RBAC permissions are working correctly
   - Monitor security audit dashboard for anomalies
