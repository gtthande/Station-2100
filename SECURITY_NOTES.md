# Security Implementation Notes

## Database & Authentication: Supabase Only

This project uses **Supabase exclusively** for all backend services:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with bucket policies
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime channels

### Critical Security Features

#### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
All user data tables have RLS enabled with policies that ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admin roles have controlled elevated access
- Security definer functions prevent infinite recursion

#### 2. Profile Data Protection
- **Sensitive fields removed**: `sample_password`, `biometric_data`, `pin_code`
- **Protected PII**: Email, phone, badge_id are conditionally shown based on roles
- **Safe views**: `profiles_safe` and `profiles_minimal` views limit data exposure
- **Audit logging**: All profile access is logged in `profile_security_log`

#### 3. Authentication Security
- Email/password only - no unsafe authentication methods
- JWT tokens managed by Supabase
- Session state properly managed with automatic token refresh
- Proper email redirect URLs configured

#### 4. Database Functions
- All functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` or `SECURITY INVOKER` appropriately
- User role checking via secure functions (`has_role`, `is_admin`)
- Input validation and sanitization in all functions

#### 5. Environment Security
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Environment variables properly namespaced (`VITE_` for client-side)
- Service role key kept server-side only

### RLS Policy Examples

```sql
-- User can only access their own records
CREATE POLICY "Users own data" ON table_name
FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admin role access
CREATE POLICY "Admin access" ON table_name  
FOR ALL USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));
```

### Security Audit Checklist

- [x] RLS enabled on all user data tables
- [x] No direct SQL execution in client code
- [x] Proper authentication flow (sign-up with email redirect)
- [x] Service role key not exposed to client
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [x] Safe profile data views
- [x] No MySQL/MariaDB artifacts
- [x] Environment variables properly configured

### Emergency Access

For emergency situations, administrators can use the `emergency_profile_access` function:
- Requires admin role
- Requires detailed justification (min 10 characters)
- All emergency access is logged and flagged for security review

### Regular Security Tasks

1. **Monitor audit logs** in `profile_security_log` and `role_audit_log`
2. **Review RLS policies** quarterly for completeness
3. **Check for unauthorized access patterns** in access logs
4. **Rotate service role keys** annually
5. **Update user permissions** as roles change

### Production Deployment

Before production:
1. Set strong passwords for all database users
2. Configure proper email templates in Supabase Auth
3. Set up monitoring for failed authentication attempts  
4. Review and test all RLS policies with different user roles
5. Ensure backup and recovery procedures are in place
