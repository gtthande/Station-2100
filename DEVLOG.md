## 🔑 Supabase API Keys Configuration (September 2025)

### Environment Security Update
- **Updated `.env.local`** with actual Supabase project keys:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://jarlvtojzqkccovburmi.supabase.co
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Configured with production anon key
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Configured with service role key
- **Updated `env-template.txt`** with proper placeholders for team setup
- **Verified code security**: No hardcoded keys found in codebase
- **Updated documentation**: Added comprehensive Supabase setup section to README.md

### Security Improvements
- **Environment validation**: Created `scripts/validate-env.ps1` and `scripts/validate-env.sh`
- **Git security**: Confirmed `.gitignore` properly excludes all environment files
- **Code review**: Verified Supabase client uses environment variables only
- **Documentation**: Added security notes and setup instructions

### Next Steps for Deployment
- **GitHub Secrets**: Add environment variables to repository secrets
- **Vercel Environment**: Configure production environment variables
- **Team onboarding**: Use `env-template.txt` for new developer setup

## 📌 Intermediate Development Report (September 2025)

This section consolidates the project’s intermediate progress, based on environment fixes, sync automation, and GitHub integration.

### Current Progress
- PowerShell scripts (`Station-2100.ps1`, `dev-health.ps1`) created and debugged.
- Helpers to kill stray `node.exe`, start the Vite dev server, and health-check `/__sync/ping` and `/__sync/status`.
- `dev-sync-plugin.ts` cleaned up to only one export default.
- `.env.local` confirmed UTF-8 encoded, no BOM/newline issues.
- Cursor all-in-one prompts built for startup/quality checks.
- `push-changes.ps1` implemented for safe commits and pushes.

### Current Status
- Dev server functional, health checks return `{ok:true}`.
- Cursor sometimes hangs mid-task → resolved by restarting with a summary.

### Issues & Challenges
1. Ensuring `.env.local` consistency across machines.  
2. Cursor occasional freezes.  
3. Need `pull-changes.ps1` for safe collaboration.

### Next Steps
- Automate `.env.local` validation and provide shared template.  
- Add `pull-changes.ps1` with conflict resolution.  
- Begin feature modules: **Job Cards**, **Inventory**, **Customers & Suppliers**.  
- Expand documentation (`README.md`, architecture diagrams).

### Restart Guide
1. Paste summary into Cursor/Lovable before resuming.  
2. Run `Station-2100.ps1`.  
3. Confirm `/__sync` endpoints respond `{ok:true}`.  
4. Use `push-changes.ps1` or `pull-changes.ps1` for GitHub sync.  
5. Continue incremental feature development.

### Conclusion
Station-2100 has reached a **stable intermediate stage**. Workflows, automation scripts, and health checks are in place. GitHub sync and Cursor integration reduce overhead. The project is now ready for **feature-rich modules** (Job Cards, Inventory, Customer/Supplier).

### Current Status
- **Development Server**: ✅ Functional at http://localhost:8080
- **Health Checks**: ✅ Return `{ok: true}` for all sync endpoints
- **Cursor Stability**: ⚠️ Occasionally hangs mid-task → resolved by restarting with summary

### Issues & Challenges
1. **Environment Consistency**: Ensuring `.env.local` consistency across machines
2. **Cursor Stability**: Occasional freezes during complex operations
3. **Git Workflow**: Need `pull-changes.ps1` for safe collaboration and conflict resolution

### Next Steps
- **Environment Validation**: Automate `.env.local` validation and provide shared template
- **Git Workflow**: Add `pull-changes.ps1` with conflict resolution
- **Feature Modules**: Begin development of **Job Cards**, **Inventory**, **Customers & Suppliers**
- **Documentation**: Expand `README.md` and create architecture diagrams

### Restart Guide
1. **Context Setup**: Paste summary into Cursor/Lovable before resuming
2. **Environment Check**: Run `.\Station-2100.ps1`
3. **Health Validation**: Confirm `/__sync` endpoints respond `{ok: true}`
4. **Git Sync**: Use `.\push-changes.ps1` or `.\pull-changes.ps1` for GitHub sync
5. **Feature Development**: Continue incremental feature development

### Conclusion
Station-2100 has established a **stable foundation** with workflows, automation scripts, and health checks in place. GitHub sync and Cursor integration reduce development overhead. The project is now ready for **feature-rich modules** including Job Cards, Inventory Management, and enhanced Customer/Supplier relationships.
