# Security Fixes Report

## Summary
Fixed critical security vulnerability: **Customer Contact Information Could Be Stolen**

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ ERROR: Customer Contact Information Could Be Stolen
**Status**: FIXED
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data including emails, phone numbers, and addresses

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Permission-Based Data Filtering**: Created `customers_secure_view` that shows/hides sensitive fields based on user permission level:
   - `view_basic`: Only name, aircraft info, city/state (no contact details)  
   - `view_contact`: Basic info + email, phone, contact person
   - `view_full`: All information including full address
   - `manage`: Full access + ability to edit

2. **Restricted Main Table Access**: Only admins and users with 'manage' permission can directly access the `customers` table

3. **Audit Logging**: All customer data access is logged in `customer_access_log` for security monitoring

4. **Data Masking**: Created `mask_sensitive_customer_data()` function for safe logging

5. **Emergency Access**: Admin-only emergency access function with mandatory justification and full audit trail

### ⚠️ WARN: Auth Settings (Requires Manual Configuration)
**Status**: REQUIRES SUPABASE DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION

The following settings must be configured in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **OTP Expiry**: Go to Authentication > Settings and set OTP expiry to 10 minutes (600 seconds)
2. **Password Protection**: Go to Authentication > Settings and enable:
   - Leaked password protection
   - Minimum password length: 8 characters
   - Strong password requirements

## Database Changes

### New Security Functions
- `log_customer_data_access()`: Logs all sensitive data access
- `mask_sensitive_customer_data()`: Masks sensitive data for logging  
- `emergency_customer_access()`: Admin emergency access with audit trail

### Updated RLS Policies
- **customers table**: Restricted to admins and managers only
- **customers_secure_view**: Permission-based field filtering

### Views Created
- **customers_secure_view**: Secure customer data access with field-level permissions

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Permission Levels
```sql
-- Test as user with 'view_basic' permission
SELECT email FROM customers_secure_view; -- Should return '[PROTECTED]'

-- Test as user with 'view_contact' permission  
SELECT email FROM customers_secure_view; -- Should return actual email

-- Test as user with no permissions
SELECT * FROM customers_secure_view; -- Should return no rows
```

### 2. Test Direct Table Access
```sql
-- Test as non-manager user
SELECT * FROM customers; -- Should fail with permission denied
```

### 3. Test Audit Logging
```sql
-- Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM customer_access_log ORDER BY accessed_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Test Emergency Access
```sql
-- Test as admin
SELECT emergency_customer_access(
  'customer-uuid-here', 
  'Emergency access needed for customer support issue #12345'
);
```

## Required Manual Configuration

### Supabase Dashboard Settings

1. **Authentication > Settings**:
   - Set OTP expiry: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
   - Enable leaked password protection
   - Set minimum password length: 8
   - Enable password strength requirements

2. **Authentication > Rate Limiting**:
   - Review and tighten rate limits for sign-in attempts

## Code Changes

### Application Layer
- ✅ Already uses `customers_secure_view` in `src/pages/Customers.tsx`
- ✅ Permission checking via `useCustomerPermissions()` hook
- ✅ Form fields conditionally shown based on permission level

### Security Features
- ✅ All customer data access is audited
- ✅ Sensitive data is masked in logs  
- ✅ Emergency access requires admin privileges and justification
- ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access

## Security Checklist

- [x] Customer contact information protected by permission levels
- [x] Direct table access restricted to authorized users only  
- [x] All data access logged for security monitoring
- [x] Emergency access procedures implemented with audit trail
- [x] Sensitive data masking for logs
- [ ] **OTP expiry configured** (requires dashboard)
- [ ] **Password protection enabled** (requires dashboard)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Supabase Dashboard Settings** (see above)
2. **Test permission levels** with different user accounts
3. **Review audit logs** regularly for suspicious activity  
4. **Train staff** on proper customer data handling procedures
