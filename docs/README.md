# Station-2100 Documentation

This folder contains reference documents and progress reports for the Station-2100 project.

## Available Reports
- [Station-2100_Intermediate.md](./Station-2100_Intermediate.md) – full intermediate stage progress report (developer-friendly)
- [Architecture Documentation](./architecture.md) – ERD, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams
- [Architecture Diagrams Folder](./architecture/) – Visual diagrams and technical specifications
- `Station-2100_Development_Intermediate.docx` – Word version of the report (local only, not tracked in GitHub)

## Notes
- Word `.docx` files are excluded from GitHub using `.gitignore`, so they remain available locally but not shared in the repository
- Always update **DEVLOG.md** when making development changes to keep the project history consistent
