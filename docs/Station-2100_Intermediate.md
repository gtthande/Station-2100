# Station-2100 Development – Intermediate Report

This document provides a comprehensive intermediate-stage summary of the Station-2100 development project.  
The Station-2100 system is a modernized, web-based inventory and workshop management platform being rebuilt with **Next.js/Vite, Supabase, Node.js, Prisma**, and supporting automation scripts.  
The goal is to replace the legacy Windows Forms application with a scalable, maintainable, and fully cloud-ready web system.

## 1. Current Progress

**PowerShell Automation Scripts**
- Created `Station-2100.ps1`, `dev-health.ps1`, and sync-related scripts.  
- Added helpers to kill stray `node.exe` processes, start the Vite dev server, and perform health checks on sync endpoints.  
- Verified that `ALLOW_SYNC=1` is properly applied in `.env.local`.

**Sync and Health Checks**
- Cleaned up `dev-sync-plugin.ts` to ensure only one export default function.  
- Confirmed `.env.local` is UTF-8 encoded with no BOM/newline corruption.  
- Verified health endpoints:  
  - `/__sync/ping` → `{ok:true, pong:true}`  
  - `/__sync/status` → `{ok:true, allow:true}`

**Cursor Integration**
- Built all-in-one prompts for Cursor to perform full quality and startup passes with zero prompts.  
- Prompts handle duplicate code, environment issues, and auto-confirm health checks.  
- Reduced manual intervention during dev startup.

**GitHub Automation**
- Implemented `push-changes.ps1` that stages, commits (with timestamp), rebases, and pushes to GitHub.  
- This enforces safe, consistent version control practices across machines.

---

## 2. Current Status

- The dev server is functional and returns valid responses from health checks.  
- Occasional instability occurs when Cursor hangs mid-task.  
- We restart sessions using a context summary, ensuring smooth continuation without redoing setup steps.

---

## 3. Issues & Challenges

1. **Environment Variable Consistency** – `.env.local` must remain identical across machines. Encoding or whitespace issues can cause errors.  
2. **Cursor Stability** – Cursor occasionally freezes during long tasks.  
3. **GitHub Sync** – While `push-changes.ps1` exists, a `pull-changes.ps1` script is needed for safer collaboration.

---

## 4. Next Steps

**Environment Reliability**
- Automate validation of `.env.local` before dev startup.  
- Provide a shared canonical template for all developers.

**GitHub Workflow Enhancements**
- Implement `pull-changes.ps1` for automated fetch, rebase, and sync.  
- Add conflict resolution helpers for smoother collaboration.

**Feature Development**
- **Job Cards** – Track workshop tasks, resource usage, and labor.  
- **Inventory** – Expand tracking with batch numbers, expiry dates, and supplier references.  
- **Customers & Suppliers** – Master-detail records with contact info, transaction logs, and reporting.

**Documentation**
- Continue maintaining `DEVLOG.md` and `README.md`.  
- Expand architecture diagrams and schema documentation.

## 5. Development Workflow Restart Guide

To restart development in Cursor or Lovable after a hang or fresh session:

1. Paste the latest development summary into the assistant.  
2. Run `Station-2100.ps1` to initialize environment and dev server.  
3. Confirm health endpoints return `{ok:true}` responses.  
4. If GitHub sync is needed, use `push-changes.ps1` or the upcoming `pull-changes.ps1`.  
5. Continue building features incrementally, documenting progress.

## 6. Conclusion

The Station-2100 project has reached a stable intermediate stage.  
Core development workflows, automation scripts, and health checks are functional.  
GitHub automation and Cursor integration reduce manual overhead, but environment consistency and collaborative sync tools remain necessary.  

The foundation is now solid enough to proceed with feature-rich modules such as **Job Cards, Inventory, and Customer/Supplier management**.  
This report serves as both a checkpoint and a guide for resuming or extending development without losing context.
