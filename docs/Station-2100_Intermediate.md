## Development Workflow Restart Guide

### Quick Resume Steps
1. **Context Setup**: Paste this summary into Cursor/Lovable for context
2. **Environment Check**: Run `.\Station-2100.ps1` to verify setup
3. **Health Validation**: Confirm `/__sync` endpoints return `{ok: true}`
4. **Git Sync**: Use `.\push-changes.ps1` or `.\pull-changes.ps1` for repository sync
5. **Feature Development**: Continue with incremental feature development

### Manual Verification
```powershell
# Check environment
Get-Content .env.local

# Verify sync endpoints
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/__sync/ping"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/__sync/status"

# Check git status
git status
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Cursor Hangs**: Restart with summary context
- **Sync Issues**: Verify `.env.local` contains `ALLOW_SYNC=1`
- **Git Conflicts**: Use `pull-changes.ps1` for safe resolution
- **Environment Issues**: Run `Station-2100.ps1` for automated setup

## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
